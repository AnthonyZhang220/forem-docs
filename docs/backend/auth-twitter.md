# Twitter Authentication

:::important

Weâ€™re currently making rapid changes to the product so our docs may be out of date. If you need help, please email [yo@forem.com](mailto:yo@forem.com).

:::

Forem allows you to authenticate using Twitter. In order to use this
authentication method in local development, you will need to setup a Twitter App
and retrieve its keys. Then you'll need to provide these keys to the Rails
application.

## Sign up

1. [Sign in](https://developer.twitter.com/apps) to your Twitter account.

2. In order to get the API keys, you will have to
   [apply for a developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).
   Click the **Apply** button.

3. Setup your Twitter account. Be sure you have your phone number and email
   address filled in.

   ![Set up Twitter account](/img/docs/backend/twitter-account-setup.png)

4. Fill in your account information and give a name to your **developer
   account**.

   ![Fill in your account information](/img/docs/backend/twitter-account-info.png)

5. Write down the reasons that you want to use Twitter API. Mention Forem's
   community and describe the issues and tests and things that you want to work
   on. Copy it, you might use it later. ;)

6. Read :) and accept the Terms and Conditions.

7. Verify your email address once more, and you will be done.

8. You are done.

## Get API keys

1. [Sign up](#twitter-sign-up) or [sign in](https://developer.twitter.com/apps)
   to your Twitter developer account.

2. From **Apps** dashboard, click on **Create and app**.

   ![Click Create and app](/img/docs/backend/twitter-createapp.png)

3. Fill in the app name, description, and URL `https://dev.to`.

   ![Add name, description, and URL](/img/docs/backend/twitter-descript.png)

4. Check the **Enable Sign in with Twitter** option and fill in the Callback URL
   `http://localhost:3000/users/auth/twitter/callback` (or whatever port you run
   Forem on).

   ![Enable sign-in](/img/docs/backend/twitter-enable.png)

5. Fill in the information, **Terms of Service** `http://dev.to/terms` and
   **Privacy policy** `http://dev.to/privacy`.

   ![Agree to terms and privacy](/img/docs/backend/twitter-privacy.png)

6. Write down (or paste) the things that you will work on. Press **Create**.

   ![Describe what you will work on](/img/docs/backend/twitter-work.png)

7. Review the
   [Twitter Developer Terms](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy.html)
   and agree to do nothing sketchy.

   ![Agree to Developer Terms](/img/docs/backend/twitter-developer-terms.png)

8. The app is all set!

9. One more change: From the app dashboard, go to **Permissions** and check
   **Request email addresses from users** option.

   ![check Request email addresses from users](/img/docs/backend/twitter-email-request.png)

10. From the same dashboard access the **Keys and tokens** and add them to your
    `.env` file accordingly (name of Twitter key -> name of our `ENV` variable).
    Be sure to copy the _access token_ and _access token secret_ right away
    because it will be hidden from you in the future.

    ```text
    API key -> TWITTER_KEY
    API secret key -> TWITTER_SECRET
    ```
