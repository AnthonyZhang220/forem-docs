# Emails

:::important

Weâ€™re currently making rapid changes to the product so our docs may be out of date. If you need help, please email [yo@forem.com](mailto:yo@forem.com).

**Setting up email**

If you would like to enable transactional email using services like SendGrid or
Mailgun, you can configure it by using the following environment variables:

```shell
SMTP_ADDRESS=         # ie. "smtp.sendgrid.net"
SMTP_PORT=            # ie. 587
SMTP_DOMAIN=
SMTP_USER_NAME=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_AUTHENTICATION=  # defaults to :plain
```

We follow the standard `ActionMailer` configuration. For more info, please check out Rails' [official documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration).

# Previewing emails in development

You can view email previews at <http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers>.

Previews are setup in the directory `spec/mailers/previews`.

# Overriding mailer templates

To update the contents of emails that the app sends, edit the views under
`app/views/mailers`. Note that this app uses the
[`devise_invitable`](https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable) gem for
invitations. The views for this gem are stored under `app/views/devise/mailer`.
